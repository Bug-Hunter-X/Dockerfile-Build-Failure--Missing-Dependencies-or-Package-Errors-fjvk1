This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Docker images: failure to properly manage dependencies. The initial Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) attempts to install Python packages using `pip3`, but it's missing the `requirements.txt` file that lists the dependencies. The corrected Dockerfile (`Dockerfile_fixed`) addresses this issue by including a sample `requirements.txt` and handling potential issues during package installation.

**Bug:**
The original Dockerfile fails to build because it tries to use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` without having a `requirements.txt` file present in the context.

**Solution:**
The corrected Dockerfile includes a `requirements.txt` listing `requests` (as an example) and uses `apt-get update` before installing packages to refresh the package list.
